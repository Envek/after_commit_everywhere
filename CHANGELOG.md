## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Allow to change callbacks' behavior when they are called outside transaction:

  ```ruby
  AfterCommitEverywhere.after_commit(without_tx: :raise) do
    # Will be executed only if was called within transaction
    # Error will be raised otherwise
  end
  ```

  Available values for `without_tx` keyword argument:
   - `:execute` to execute callback immediately
   - `:warn_and_execute` to print warning and execute immediately
   - `:raise` to raise an exception instead of executing

## 1.1.0 (2021-08-05)

### Added

- Allow to call transactional callbacks directly on `AfterCommitEverywhere` module:

  ```ruby
  AfterCommitEverywhere.after_commit { puts "If you see me then transaction has been successfully commited!" }
  ```

- Allow to call `in_transaction?` helper method from instance methods in classes that includes `AfterCommitEverywhere` module.
